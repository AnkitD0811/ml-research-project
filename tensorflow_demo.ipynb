    "## How Tensorflow Works\n",
    "\n",
    "It is comprised of 2 main parts:\n",
    "1. Graphs\n",
    "2. Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow graph is a representation of computations structured as a directed graph. Nodes in the graph represent operations, which are units of computation, and edges represent the flow of tensors, which are the data that moves between operations. Graphs define the structure of the computation but do not execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow session provides an environment for executing the operations defined in a graph. It allocates resources, such as memory, and manages the execution order of operations. To execute a graph, it needs to be launched within a session. Sessions allow for the evaluation of tensors and the execution of operations, producing results. It allows the user to execute a part of the graph or the entire graph depending on the requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow 2.x uses eager mode execution by default, which is explained later."

Operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later. This makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow and debug models.\n",

Before version 2.x was released, Eager execution was disabled by default. This meant that every graph had to be run within a TensorFlow session. This only allowed for the entire graph to be run all at once and made it hard to debug the computation graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "- An intuitive interface - Structure your code naturally and use Python data structures. Quickly iterate on small models and small data.\n",
    "- Easier debugging - Execute operations directly to inspect code line by line and test changes. Use standard Python debugging tools for immediate error reporting.\n",
    "- Natural control flow — Use Python control flow instead of graph control flow, simplifying the specification of dynamic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eager execution is much easier to develop and debug code, while to get better efficiency, ability to run tensorflow code on distributed systems and systems with no python interpreters, Graph execution is better, as it makes a graph model that can be exported.\n",
